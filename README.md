### Ecoacoustic equipment and survey design

#### Acoustic recorders

Here is a list of the most widely used acoustic recorders for long-term soundscape monitoring in a variety of environments.

### Types of acoustic survey design

Deciding the best way to deploy your acoustic recorders in the environment that you plan to survey is very important and worthy of careful consideration. The optimal way to deploy your recorders will depend on several factors, including, how many recorders you have, how frequently they need to be serviced, and the research questions that you are interested in answering. 

#### Line transect 
Line transects involve collecting data along predetermined linear paths (transects) within the study area. This is especially useful for studying gradients or patterns over space.

#### Random sampling 

Simple random sampling:
Involves randomly selecting sample sites or individuals from the entire study area. It's useful for ensuring each unit has an equal chance of being sampled.

Stratified random sampling: 
Divides the study area into subgroups (strata) based on certain characteristics (e.g., habitat type) and then randomly samples within each stratum. This ensures representation of different ecosystem components.

 #### Recording schedule and parameters   

Something else to carefully consider is your recording schedule and parameters. Acoustic recorders can be pre-programmed to record continuously, or selectively (e.g., 1 min in every 10). There are pros and cons to each approach, but the benefits of selective recording schedules, such as longer intervals between servicing the recorders, are clear for long-term soundscape monitoring.

You can also modify the sample rate (kHz), gain (dB), and other more detailed parameters such as trigger type and filtering. These settings will largely be dictated by your research question. For example, high sample rates (>192 kHz) and selective trigger types are ideal for bat surveys, whereas mid-range sample rates (~48 kHz) and no triggers are ideal for soundscape monitoring.        

###  Spectrograms

#### What are spectrograms?

A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. As a result, spectrograms are a useful tool for ecologists in the identification of species-specific sounds that produce unique spectrograms. 

Spectrograms are calculated using the "Fast Fourier Transform" (FFT), an important measurement method in the science of audio and acoustics measurement. Put simply, the algorithm converts a signal into individual spectral components (frequencies) and thereby provides frequency information about the signal.

Below is an example of a single sound wave (left) and the Fast Fourier Transformation (right) that considers all of the spectral components (frequencies) in a sound file over time. Sounds with a higher frequency have a higher wavelength.

Here is an example of a spectrogram containing two different species of water boatman recorded in a lake near Bristol.

###  Acoustic indices 

#### What are acoustic indcies?

Acoustic indcies are mathametical functions that consider spectral and temporal information obtained from audio recordings. As a result, acoustic indices are a useful tool for ecologists in the analysis of large audio datasets to describe broad-scale changes over time and monitor biodiversity without the need to determine species identity. 

Many different types of acoustic indcies exist, however, here is a list of the most commonly used indices. 

| Acoustic index                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Developed for                                                                                      | Reference                                                 |

| Spectral entropy (Hf)                         | “Measures the evenness of the amplitude envelope over the time units… by dividing the Shannon index by its maximum” (Sueur et al., 2008)                                                                                                                                                                                  | Terrestrial fauna (in a coastal forest, Tanzania)                                                  | Sueur et al.

### Worked examples in R

Now we're going to work through some practical examples of what we've been talking about in R. 

#### Importing audio files and creating spectrograms

```
#install and load packages
install.packages("tuneR")
install.packages("seewave")
library(tuneR)
library(seewave)

#import water boatman data
Water_boatman <- readWave("Water boatman.wav")

#investigate signal
meanspec(Water_boatman)

#plot water boatman spectrogram
spectro(Water_boatman, wl=1200, flim = c(0,6), collevels = seq(-25,0))
```

#### Calculating acoustic indices and visualising the data

```
#install and load packages
install.packages("soundecology")
library(soundecology)

#
multiple_sounds("name_of_your_respository", resultfile = "name_of_your_output.csv",
                soundindex = "bioacoustic_index")
```
